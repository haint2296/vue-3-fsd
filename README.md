## Main Components

- **app/**: Application bootstrap, router config, styles, mock server bootstrap.
- **entities/**: Domain entities (currently empty, for shared entities).
- **features/**: Place for developing independent, reusable features (currently empty).
- **pages/**: Contains main application pages, each page in its own folder.
- **shared/**: Shared components such as UI, services, libraries, API hooks, mock server, etc.
  - **lib/axios/**: Axios configuration and custom instance.
  - **services/api/**: Auto-generated code from OpenAPI (orval), including models, types (zod), API hooks.
  - **services/msw/**: Mock service worker configuration for API simulation in development.
  - **ui/query-boundary/**: UI component for query boundaries (loading, error, data).

## Technologies Used

- [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [@tanstack/vue-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/vue/overview)
- [MSW (Mock Service Worker)](https://mswjs.io/)
- [Orval](https://orval.dev/) (auto-generates API code from OpenAPI)
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) (schema validation)
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Notes

- In development mode, MSW will automatically start to mock API requests.
- API hooks are auto-generated from the openapi.yaml file using orval.
- You can extend features, entities, and pages as needed for your real use case.
